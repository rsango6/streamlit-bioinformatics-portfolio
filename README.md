This is an app giving a walktrough of two different aspects in life sciences: 
  1) inspecting RNA-seq data for most significant differentially expressed genes, and a volcano plot that interactively changes the values based on user-provided significance and L2FC tresholds. (first version is online)
  2) exploratory data analysis of machine learning dataset predicting a re-hospitalization classification from the clinical dataset (data anonymized). (*work in progress**)
